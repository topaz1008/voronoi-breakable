voronoi-breakable
========================
# WIP
[Live demo](https://topaz1008.github.io/voronoi-breakable/); it will shoot 2 boxes towards each other on load, but you can click the mouse anywhere to shoot more.

You can also pause/unpause using the `P` key.

Eventually going to be a demo utilizing [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) and voronoi diagrams to create a breakable rigid bodies simulation.
